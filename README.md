# CS263-Project

## File Description
The `NBC-new_wikipedia_dataset.ipynb` file contains all the source codes for reading the Wikipedia dataset, training the Naive Bayes Classifier and testing on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank benchmark.

The `NBC_news.ipynb` file does the same thing using the News dataset.

The `bert.ipynb` file contains the code needed to run the BERT model and training using either News or Wikipedia dataset. In the end, it will evaluate their performance on Stanford Sentiment Treebank benchmark.
